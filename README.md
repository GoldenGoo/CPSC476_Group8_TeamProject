# CPSC476_Group8_TeamProject
This project is a web based game, developed in python using Django. The intention is to make an educational game for children, that will later be paired with a robot which interacts with the children. This project is made for the Social Robotics course, in the fall semester of 2025 at UNBC.

# Requirements
All of the libraries should be included in the code downloaded from the git repo, so no dependencies needed to be configured. You will need to be able to run python commands.

# Instructions to run
To properly host the project, open the terminal, navigate to the CPSC476_Group8_TeamProject directory, and activate the virtual environment. This can be done by running the Activate.ps1 script in venv/Scripts.
Once the virtual environment is running, you should have access to all the built in Django functionality, allowing you to execute the command py manage.py runserver. If this does not work it is likely because you have a different python version configured. You can modify the 'py' in the original command to whatever your specific version of python or environment variables are set up for.
